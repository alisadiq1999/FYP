# Attentiveness-Monitoring-System
AMS(Attentiveness Monitoring System)  Monitoring attentiveness of the audience is a difficult task for the human evaluators, therefore; our proposed model will detect an individual person through the camera in run-time, will implement BodyPosture Detection, Head Pose Estimation, and Facial Expressions Recognition to finally determine how attentive that particular individual was throughout the session. This model will assist the human evaluator and will be implemented using the concepts of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This proposed system can be implemented in future to cope up with the pandemic situation that we are facing these days as its difficult for teachers to monitor attentiveness of whole class thus, this system can assist the teacher on measuring how attentive are the students of the class by measuring attentiveness of individual student and then giving collective result.
